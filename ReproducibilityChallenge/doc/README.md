# Artifact of Reproducibility Challenge

## Contents of artifact

### Compile

It contains compilation scripts, vectorization report for CPU code, README and environment info. See `compile/README.md` for detail.

### Run

It contains "run" scripts for single CPU and GPU, strong scaling on CPU and GPU. See `run/scripts/README.md` for detail.

### Figures

It contians scripts to draw out version of Figure 9 and Figure 11, the visualization of the output of MemXCT done with Fiji and some comments. See `figures/output/README.md` and `figures/scripts/README.md` for detail.

## Figures/Table data used in report


Table 4: The STREAM results come from `run/output/single_cpu/single_amd/stream_result.txt` and `run/output/single_cpu/single_intel/stream_result.txt`

Figure 1: It uses `figures/output/{bw, gflops}_single_cpu.pdf`
Figure 2: It uses `figures/output/{bw, gflops}_single_gpu.pdf`
Figure 3: It uses `figures/output/{CDS1, CDS2}_strong_scaling_on_{cpu, gpu}.pdf`
Figure 4: It is from `figures/output/{24.60.CDS3.64.64.1024.1024.32.32.png, v100.12.CDS1.128.128.512.512.48.48.png, v100.24.CDS2.128.128.512.512.48.48.png}`. These images are generated by Fiji from coressponding reconstructed tomogram binary.

# Figures scripts

## Requirements

We use matplotlib to draw plots. Use `pip3` to install matplotlib:

```bash
pip3 install -U matplotlib
```

## Draw plots

We use one unified `draw.py` to collect data from `run/output` and print figures. It contains four subcommands: `sc` for single CPU, `sg` for single GPU, `ssc` for strong scaling for CPU and `ssg` for strong scaling for GPU.

Some example usage:

```shell
# Plot single CPU results on 
```
